# PWA & GPS Testing Guide

## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. GPS Location Tracking in Booking
- **Fixed**: [book/nurse/page.tsx](./src/app/book/nurse/page.tsx#L121) now automatically gets patient's GPS location during booking
- **Fallback**: If GPS fails, prompts user to enter address manually
- **Result**: Nurses will now see actual patient addresses instead of "Not provided"

### 2. Nurse "Start Visit" Button
- **Fixed**: [api/bookings/[id]/route.ts](./src/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts#L69) now allows "IN_PROGRESS" status
- **Result**: Nurses can now successfully click "Start Visit" without errors

### 3. Native PWA Install
- **New Component**: [NativePWAInstall.tsx](./src/components/NativePWAInstall.tsx) replaces old InstallButton
- **Android**: Uses native `beforeinstallprompt` → shows "Install app?" dialog
- **iOS**: Custom modal with proper Share → Add to Home Screen instructions
- **Debugging**: Console logs to track install events

## Testing Steps

### PWA Install Testing:
1. Open app on **Android Chrome/Edge**
2. Look for green "Install App" button in header
3. Click it → should show native "Install CareBridge?" popup (not "Add to Home Screen")
4. Accept → app installs as standalone PWA

### iOS Testing:
1. Open app on **iOS Safari**
2. Click "Install" button → shows custom modal with proper instructions
3. Follow instructions: Share → Add to Home Screen → Add

### GPS Location Testing:
1. Go to `/book/nurse` as a patient
2. Select service, date, time
3. Click "Book Appointment"
4. Browser should request location permission
5. If granted → address shows in booking for nurse
6. If denied → manual address prompt appears

### Nurse Assignment Testing:
1. Login as nurse
2. Go to assignments dashboard
3. Click "Start Visit" on a booking
4. Should update status to "IN_PROGRESS" without errors
